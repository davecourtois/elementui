# elementui
## it's elementui my dear watson!

elementui regroup usefull and simple web-component ready to be use in your application. The focus is put on simplicity and extensibility. Style and event handling are easily overridable like plain JavaScript and CSS. I also try to create missing component instead of reapeat existing one. There's already enought button component in this world! When no existing component fit my need I create a new one, table, menu and dialog are good exemple. I made use of polymer 3 to create my component, and I use iron-element and paper-element as building block for most of my components. So if you want component that follow material design principle you looking at the good place.

Enought talking let look at components!
